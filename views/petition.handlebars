<h1>Welcome to the Petition Page against {{petitionName}}</h1>
<p>
    "Dear fellow Apple users and supporters of innovation, We are writing to ask
    for your support in our campaign to reduce the unfair and excessive Apple
    IOS tax on all purchases made on Apple devices. As you may know, Apple
    currently charges a tax of 30% on all purchases made through its App Store,
    which disproportionately affects small and independent developers who rely
    on the App Store to distribute their products. This tax not only puts a
    financial burden on developers, but it also stifles innovation and
    competition within the industry. By imposing such a high tax, Apple
    effectively maintains its monopoly position and hinders the growth of new
    and innovative products. We believe that this tax is unfair and unjust, and
    we call on Apple to reduce it to a fair and reasonable level. Join us in
    signing this petition to send a message to Apple that we demand change.
    Together, we can create a more equitable and innovative App Store ecosystem.
    Thank you for your support."</p>
